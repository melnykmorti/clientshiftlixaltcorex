							request additional information and documents, including but not
							limited to scan of your ID document valid in your country and
							additional information of the funds' origin.
						</p>
						<p>
							3.4. In limited cases (such as to verify your identity in order to
							pass the AML/KYC procedure), we reserve the right to freeze your
							exchange transaction for any period of time necessary to complete
							the investigation and AML/KYC procedure.
						</p>
						<p>
							While the investigation is ongoing, CrossCourse reserves the right

							for ensuring their safekeeping.
						</p>

							CrossCourse has the right to refuse to execute your transactions
							(current and future).
						</p>

						<p>
							3.8.2. The verification time window is 3 days, and the User can

						</p>
						<p>
							In limited cases (if the transaction is suspected of being

						</p>
						<h3 id="4-personal-data">4. Personal Data</h3>
						<p>

						</h3>
						<p>
							5.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are highly experimental and
							risky.
						</p>
						<p>
							5.2. CrossCourse’s conversion service attempts to provide accurate
							price and exchange rate information, but this information is
							highly volatile and can change quickly without Users necessarily
							being aware of these changes.
						</p>
						<p>
							5.3. For normal orders, the exchange rate you receive is
							calculated at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying
							security between blockchain, your payment is typically considered
							“accepted” at six blocks confirmation. It is important to note
							that a payment being broadcast to the blockchain network does not
							constitute an acceptance by CrossCourse of that payment.
						</p>
						<p>
							5.4. The CrossCourse’s interest (the CrossCourse’s remuneration for
							the using of its services and the Website) is included in the
							final rate of the User’s change transactions. You don’t need to
							pay additional fees directly to the CrossCourse, unless otherwise
							provided by these Terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							5.5. Please, contact the customer support (
							<a href="mailto:crosscourse.online@gmail.com" style={{overflowWrap:"anywhere"}}>crosscourse.online@gmail.com</a>)
							for more information on exchange rates and prices.
						</p>
						<p>
							5.6. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any,
							taxes apply to the changes you complete via the Website and our
							services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the
							correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that
							CrossCourse is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply
							to your exchanges or for collecting, reporting, withholding or
							remitting any taxes arising from any transactions.
						</p>
						<h3 id="6-returns-and-refund-policy">
							6. Returns and Refund Policy
						</h3>
						<p>
							6.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are, by their nature,
							generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly
							volatile and transitory. We cannot be responsible for any risk in
							use of the Website, including but not limited to exchange rate
							risk and market risk. All sales and transactions after the
							CrossCourse exchange are final and amount is non-refundable.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.2. If an error occurs with a User’s exchange or interface on the
							User’s side of the transaction, the “Order Status” page on the
							Website will indicate whether or not the failed exchange will
							result in a refund of the User’s deposited Digital Asset or the
							outgoing Digital Asset to which the User was exchanging.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.3. The Digital Asset deposited by the User will be refunded to
							the User if the “Order Status” page either:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								indicates the exchange failed by displaying “failed” message;
								or,
							</li>
							<li>
								indicates the exchange got stuck in “awaiting exchange”,
								“pending confirms” or “awaiting deposit” stages.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							6.4. The outgoing Digital Asset will be exchanged and sent to the
							User if the “Order Status” page indicates a successful exchange by
							displaying “Done” or “Completed”.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.5. Any decisions by CrossCourse with respect to refunds or
							exchanges are final.
						</p>
						<p>6.6. Please, note:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								All transactions from CrossCourse to the User’s outgoing Digital
								Asset wallet shall be subject to all posted fees, including but
								not limited to miner fees.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Digital Assets extraction process can take up to twenty (20)
								business days. If the User wishes to expedite this process,
								additional charges may apply.
							</li>
							<li>
								Unsupported Digital Assets that are deposited into our system to
								unrelated wallets cannot be extracted or returned. CrossCourse

								deposited when no longer supported are final.
							</li>
							<li>
								Transactions below the minimum limits determined on the Website
								can not be completed.
							</li>
							<li>
								When the User provides a destination address, this is the only
								address that output funds can be sent to. Any decisions by
								CrossCourse with respect to refunds in these circumstances are
								final.
							</li>
							<li>
								When the User requests the refund, it can be issued either to
								the initial address or the refund address specified at exchange
								creation only. The refund cannot be issued to a new address. To
								request a refund the User should contact CrossCourse's support
								team at (

								Any decisions by CrossCourse with respect to refunds are final.
							</li>
							<li>
								CrossCourse only accepts one (1) deposit per transaction ID
								(TXID). If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one
								(1) deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a
								refund. The exchange rate will not be honored and your exchange
								cannot be completed.
							</li>
							<li>
								WARNING: There are fake websites pretending to be CrossCourse’s
								Website (aka “phishing scams”). They use a misspelled URL that
								looks like “CrossCourse.io” in order to trick the Users into
								sending them funds. DO NOT USE ANY SERVICE THAT ISN'T EXACTLY
								LOCATED AT THE DOMAIN: “CrossCourse.io”.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							CrossCourse is not responsible for funds that have been sent to
							these fake phishing sites. It is important that all Users shall
							verify they are visiting the correct URL (CrossCourse.io) on their
							own and search for the security certificate in the URL bar of
							their browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, never trust private messages, solicitations or requests for
							funds from people claiming to be CrossCourse unless you have
							verified that it is an official request from a CrossCourse’s
							employee.
						</p>
						<p>
							In case of doubt, contact us directly to verify any messaging.
							Stay diligent - and please report any phishing scams to our team (
							<a href="mailto:crosscourse.online@gmail.com" style={{overflowWrap:"anywhere"}}>
							crosscourse.online@gmail.com
							</a>
							).
						</p>
						<p>
							6.7. If there are dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market,
							CrossCourse can not exchange Cryptocurrency on the fix rate. In this
							case CrossCourse shall carry out exchange transactions at the market
							rate or return the Cryptocurrency to the User at the choice of the
							latter. The Parties agree that under “dramatic changes in the
							cryptocurrency market” they understand the changes in the
							cryptocurrency rates equal to 3% or higher in any direction.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.8. If there are any changes in the cryptocurrency market and the
							User decided to take any advantages of the Website's
							vulnerability, CrossCourse can not complete the exchange
							transactions of such User and shall return him or her the
							Cryptocurrency.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.9. If you accidentally sent BCH to a SegWit BTC address that
							belongs to CrossCourse, we will be able to make a refund if the
							amount sent is equivalent to or exceeds 60 US dollars. The fee of
							such operation will be 15% of the amount, but not less than 50 US
							dollars deducted from the BCH deposit. We cannot guarantee the
							possibility of returning assets other than BCH sent to the SegWit
							BTC address. To request a refund, kindly{" "}

							6.10 Please note that token refunds sent to our ERC-20 address
							incorrectly may take up to 24 hours.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.11 According to financial theft victim reports, in limited cases
							CrossCourse is able to stop funds stolen from a client or a company.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that the transaction might be stopped after the
							trading stage, depending on the time the report was received. In
							such cases, we will be able to return the funds in the asset to
							which the exchange was made (to-currency).
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to return such funds, CrossCourse will need a request of a
							Law Enforcement Authority, which clearly states that the mentioned
							funds should be returned. The hard copy of the request should be
							sent to our postal address: Newtonlaan 115, Utrecht, 3584 BH,
							Netherlands. Please send a digital copy of the request to{" "}
							<a href="mailto:crosscourse.online@gmail.com" style={{overflowWrap:"anywhere"}}>
